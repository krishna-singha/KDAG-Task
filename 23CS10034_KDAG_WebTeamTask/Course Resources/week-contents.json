      "content": "Distributed computing involves the use of multiple interconnected computers working together to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up data processing tasks by dividing them into smaller sub-tasks that are processed simultaneously across various nodes. Scalability is a crucial aspect, allowing the system to handle increasing amounts of data and computational load by simply adding more nodes to the network. Fault tolerance ensures that the system remains operational even when some components fail, achieved through mechanisms such as data replication and task reallocation, which provide robustness and reliability. Distributed computing is essential for efficiently managing large-scale data processing and complex computations in various fields, from scientific research to commercial applications."
